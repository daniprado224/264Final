# 264 Final
Final project for web programming spring 2023. 
This project is a crossword puzzle with different levels of difficulty.
Each level has it's own theme and a different amount of words and clues. 
Easy level: 
    - This level is based on vocabulary words learned in this class. 
Medium level: 
    - This level is based on the Computer Science program at Lehigh. 
Hard level: 
    - This level is more general and is based on being an engineering student at Lehigh. 
A crossword puzzle is generated based on the player's choice. Once all the words are submitted by the player
an alert will let them know if they won or not. In the case the player filled out all the words but did not 
do it correctly, nothing will be alerted by the website.
